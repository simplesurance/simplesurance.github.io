## Writing an Article
writing an article follows the same pattern as subimitting code. First, you create a `branch` with where you add corresponding files of your article, then you create a `pull request` that will be reviewed (grammar and content) by someone self-designated (though it is encouraged that you suggest a well suited reviewer for your content). Once you get an approval for your PR, it will be merged and published.

1. Clone or Fork this repository.
2. Create a new branch from `master`.
3. Create a new file inside `/pages/{year}/` named after your post title.
4. Push your code and submit a `pull request`
5. After submiting, go to your `pull request` page, point a `Reviewer` on the sidebar and add the label `post` to it.

Thank you.
