## Can I write?
At present, the Simplesurance Tech is a blog intended to Simplesurance personel to share their technical knowledge in an Open-Sourced way. That being said, **if you are a Simplesurance employee regardless of your Team we'd appreciate very much if you wrote an article!**

## Writing an Article
writing an article follows the same pattern as subimitting code. First, you create a `branch` with where you add corresponding files of your article, then you create a `pull request` that will be reviewed (grammar and content) by someone self-designated (though it is encouraged that you suggest a well suited reviewer for your content). Once you get an approval for your PR, it will be merged and published.

1. Clone or Fork this repository.
2. Create a new branch from `master`.

Branches should follow a specific naming pattern: `post/{post-title}`.

For example, the *Introduction to Javascript* post, would be written on the `post/introduction-to-js` branch.

3. Create a new file inside `/pages/{year}/` named after your post title.

Considering the current year to be 2017, the *Introduction to Javascript* would be written on the file:

```
/pages/2017/introduction-to-javascript
```
> this will defined the URL of your post, keep simple, keep it readable and SEO friendly. 😉

File Content:

```
import Post from '../../layouts/post'
import md from 'markdown-in-js'

export default () => <Post>{ md`
Write your post here.
`}</ Post>
```

4. Push your code and submit a `pull request`
5. After submiting, go to your `pull request` page, point a `Reviewer` on the sidebar and add the label `post` to it.

Thank you. 🎉
